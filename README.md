# Speech-Disfluency-Detection-with-Contextual-Representation-and-Data-Distillation

This is the codebase with the distilled data from SEP-28k repository and DisfluencyNet Architecture for classifying five types of speech disfluencies.
The training scripts, training data and test data are checked in under /train_scripts/.
We are working on a detailed readme file and supplementary code support for data preparation from SEP-28k for filtering only high-inter-annotator data.
